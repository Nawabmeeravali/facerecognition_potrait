# facerecognition_potrait

Various mobile devices nowadays are coming with the feature or ability to take potrait images. If on mobile devices then why not on the laptop (joking !!).

This is just a small scarp pf python code using opencv and various other image libraries in python so as to show how a simple potrait image can even be obtained through laptop camera.

for running this code you have to install any Python IDEs like : Spyder3, Pycharm, Anaconda, etc
After installing import libraries like :
1. cv2
2. PIL
Before this you have to install python-pip3.

Run the code and obtain the result.

#TODO
1. Shortly use on mobile devices
2. Implement algorithms and deep learning
