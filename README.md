# facerecognition_potrait

Various mobile devices nowadays are coming with the feature or ability to take potrait images. If on mobile devices then why not on the laptop (joking !!).

This is just a small scrap pf python code using opencv and various other image libraries in python so as to show how a simple potrait image can even be obtained through laptop camera.

for running this code you have to install any Python IDEs like : Spyder3, Pycharm, Anaconda, etc
After installing import libraries like :
1. cv2
2. PIL
Before this you have to install python-pip3.

Run the code and obtain the result.

Using:
1. Press 'S' to take image. Check whether the window is selected or not.
2. Press 'Esc' to exit. #Clicking the cross won't exit it.



#TODO
1. Shortly use on mobile devices
2. Implement algorithms and deep learning
